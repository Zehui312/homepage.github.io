<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a biomedical scientist with research interests in **pathogen genomics**, **computational biology**, and **data-driven analysis of infectious diseases**.  
My research focuses on genome-based characterization of viruses and bacteria, comparative genomics, and the application of bioinformatics and high-throughput sequencing data to infectious disease research and public health–related studies.

I have contributed to peer-reviewed research in pathogen genomics and related biomedical fields, with publications cited by the international scientific community.
